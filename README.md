Angular Bootstrap template
=====

A generic template for self-development.

My target is to have a clean project to create a Yeoman self-contained generator with a proper gruntfile with:
- js test runner and reporter with jasmine,
- jsdocs builder,
- uglify and minification,
- less,
- some deployment tasks,
- and all the necessary to work efficiently (watch, connect, etc.)
- 
The website will use Twitter Bootstrap with Angular.js.
